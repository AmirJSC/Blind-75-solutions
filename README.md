# Data Structures

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to the Blind-75 problems. Below are the concepts and their definitions that will be useful in solving these problems.

### Hash maps

Hash maps are common data structures used to store key-value pairs for efficient retrieval. 

Hashmap data structures use hash functions which turns a key into an index within an underlying array. The hash function can be used to access an index when inserting a value or retrieving a value from a hash map. 

### Stack

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order may be FILO (First In Last Out).
